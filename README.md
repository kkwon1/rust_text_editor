# Rust Text Editor

I'm in the process of learning Rust and felt it would be fun to follow along and build a Text Editor in Rust. The following links were useful in this exercise:

1. [Hecto](https://www.philippflenker.com/hecto/)
2. [Kyun (a hilarious text editor)](https://github.com/file-acomplaint/kyun)
3. [Crossterm crate](https://crates.io/crates/crossterm)
4. [Guide to build text editor in C](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html)
